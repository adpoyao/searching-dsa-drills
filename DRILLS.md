# DATA STRUCTURES
* Array
* Linked List
  - Stack
  - Queue
* Hash Map
* Binary Search Tree

# SORTING ALGORITHM
* Linear
* Binary:
  - Depth First
  - Breadth First

# EXERCISE 1
For this exercise 1 and 2, you will be using a searching algorithm to search for an item in a dataset. You will be testing the efficiency of the two searching algorithm, Linear search and Binary search. You will also have UI (a simple textbox will do) through which you will be sending your input that you want to seach. There is no server side to this program. All of this is done using React (or if you prefer, JQuery, whichever you are comfortable with). Given the following dataset, find out how many tries did it take to search for a particular item in the dataset. If the item is not in the dataset, provide a message and indicate how many searches did it take to do so.

89 30 25 32 72 70 51 42 25 24 53 55 78 50 13 40 48 32 26 2 14 33 45 72 56 44 21 88 27 68 15 93 98 73 28 16 46 87 28 65 38 67 16 85 63 23 69 64 91 9 70 81 27 97 82 6 88 3 7 46 13 11 64 31 26 38 28 13 17 69 90 1 6 7 64 43 9 73 80 98 46 27 22 87 49 83 6 39 42 51 54 84 34 53 78 40 14 5 76 62

# EXERCISE 2
Use the dataset from the previous exercise and the same front end for this exercise. Use array.sort to sort the dataset. Then implement Binary search to find a particular value in the dataset.

## UI
1. Box (Input)
2. Button (Linear)
3. Button (Binary)
4. Stateful Component (class)

## STRATEGY
1. If Linear: No need to sort. Simple for loop and retrieve [i]; include counter.
2. If Binary: Sort Data. Binary search function needs to include counter.
